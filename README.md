This is a demo Application where I am testing multiple and different things

e.g.

  Azure service buss
  
  REST Full API / GraphQL
  
  Swagger documentation
  
  API Versioning
  
  Authorization and Authentication
  
  MediatR
  
  SeriLog
  
  Clean architecture
  
  Sharing contracts between front/back - end
  
  Entity Framework
  
  Generic Repository
  
  Azure

These are a few things that come to my mind ...

I like to discover and implement new things, I learn on my own free time and try to implement these things in this "dummy" application.
The goal is to test and challenge myself to learn new things.
Some things are also not fully implemented or correctly implemented but will be fixed in time ...
